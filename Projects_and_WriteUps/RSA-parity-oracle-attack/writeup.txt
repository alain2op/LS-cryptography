I couldn't completely solve this and there seems to be a slight shift for my output and I am unable to figure out the cause.
I have filled the rsa class and the oracle function with standard rsa theory
Then for the oracle-attack, regarding multiplying the ciphertext with 2 , and proceeded with the current solution, though there is still an error in my solution.
