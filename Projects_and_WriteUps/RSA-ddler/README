In this script detective I have used RSA but with a small little twist. 
Standard RSA uses the condition ed==1 modulo phi but not here.
You have the public and private key list, ofcourse some redacted. The private key has 
been calculated as follows:

Suppose the index of the private key is i, then it has been calculated by solving the congruence
(e**i)*d==1 modulo phi where e,d,phi are the ith elements of their list respectively.
example: d[2] would be calculated as (e[2]**2)*d[2]==1 modulo phi[2] and so on.

Now go on detective, get the flag!
